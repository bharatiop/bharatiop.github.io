- title: "Impact of the equation of state on f- and p- mode oscillations of neutron stars"
  image: fmode2.png
  description: We investigated neutron star equations of state and their impact on f- and p-mode oscillation frequencies within Cowling and linearized general relativity. We found strong correlations between these frequencies, nuclear matter properties, and the pressure of β-equilibrated matter at or near nuclear saturation density ρ0, regardless of star composition. Notably, the p1-mode frequency in a 1.4 M⊙ star correlated significantly with the slope of symmetry energy (L0) and β-equilibrated pressure at ρ0, shedding light on neutron star intricacies.

- title: "Inferring neutron star properties from GW170817 with universal relations"
  image: tidal1.png
  description: We have used equation-of-state (EoS) insensitive relations between neutron star (NS) observables to translate the GW170817 canonical tidal deformability measurement into bounds on the properties of all neutron stars. In particular, if we assume a common neutron star  EoS, then GW170817 constrains radii, moment-of-inertia and  tidal deformability for other binary NS and pulsar systems. These quasi-universal relations can further be used to combine separate X-ray and GW observations independently of the EoS, leading to joint constraints on tidal deformability.

- title: "New relativistic effective interaction for finite nuclei, infinite nuclear matter, and neutron stars"
  image: tidal2.png
  description: We've developed G3 and IOPB-I parameter sets for energy density functions in finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter, using effective field theory motivated relativistic mean field (ERMF) formalism. Our results align with experimental data, including the neutron-skin thickness of Pb-208 nucleus and neutron star radius from GW170817. Our low-density equation of state for pure neutron matter matches other models, and we also compute maximum mass and tidal deformability in agreement with GW170817 and pulsar data.

- title: "Constraints on the Moment of Inertia of PSR J0737-3039A from GW170817"
  image: moi.png
  description: We found that the tidal deformability strongly correlates with the linear combinations of the slopes of nuclear isoscalar incompressibility and symmetry energy coefficients, all fall-outs of the nuclear equation of state. For the first time, we also found that the tidal deformability is approximately proportional to the sixth power of the radius of neutron star for a wide range of neutron star masses. This relation together with the bounds on the tidal deformability obtained from the GW170817 and its UV/optical/infrared electromagnetic counterparts constrain the radius of the neutron star with canonical mass in the range 11.82 - 13.72 km.
