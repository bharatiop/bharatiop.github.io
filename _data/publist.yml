  description: We investigated neutron star equations of state and their impact on f- and p-mode oscillation frequencies within Cowling and linearized general relativity. We found strong correlations between these frequencies, nuclear matter properties, and the pressure of β-equilibrated matter at or near nuclear saturation density ρ0, regardless of star composition. Notably, the p1-mode frequency in a 1.4 M⊙ star correlated significantly with the slope of symmetry energy (L0) and β-equilibrated pressure at ρ0, shedding light on neutron star intricacies.
